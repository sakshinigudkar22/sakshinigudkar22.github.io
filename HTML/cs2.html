        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="bodytext">Amid the pandemic, Online Shopping has increased rapidly. Although online shopping has
            drastically changed the way people shop, users still face a number of problems while shopping online.
            E-commerce websites fail to provide an immersive experience. Their design isn’t optimized to make experience
            user friendly. On the contrary it confuses user.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">With the technological advancement and a better UX design, it’s possible to turn the tables
            and make the customers happy and satisfied.
            That’s when I boarded on a journey to a design for a e-commerce website that tries to solve user pain points
            and make the journey frictionless.

        <p class="bodytext">I’ve presented the case study in a linear fashion but I follow a lean approach towards
            designing. Sometimes I brainstorm a few ideas before I’ve conducted user research. It helps me to enter the
            problem more naturally. Or sometimes even when I’ve completed the research and I’m still prototyping, I
            constantly look for any new insights from potential users.
            I believe the process of designing is never ending because there’s no ‘Perfect’ design.

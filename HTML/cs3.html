        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="bodytext">While I was working on my third portfolio project for Google UX Design Course which was a
            Responsive Website for an NGO I realized that very less number of NGOs had an independent platform to
            connect with their volunteers.

            As I conducted user interviews, the problem became clearer. Usually the campaigns or programs conducted by
            NGOs were missed by it’s volunteers due to lack of information.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">The volunteers too needed a way to socialize with like minded people. That’s when I decided
            that I am going to try to find a way through it by designing a platform for volunteers.

        <p class="bodytext">I’ve presented the case study in a linear fashion but I follow a lean approach towards designing. Sometimes I brainstorm a few ideas before I’ve conducted user research. It helps me to enter the problem more naturally. Or sometimes even when I’ve completed the research and I’m still prototyping, I constantly look for any new insights from potential users. 
            I believe the process of designing is never ending because there’s no ‘Perfect’ design.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p class="bodytext">
                The app is instrumental as a bridge between the volunteers and NGOs.It'll facilitate volunteers to find new opportunities easily as well as the NGOs can recruit skilled professions to get the tasks done.
                User can acheive the satisfaction of contributing towards the society.

One quote from peer feedback:

            <div class="ibox">
                <p class="itext">
                    “The filters are amazing and the reminder feature is very helpful. I hope different NGOs come together and develop such an app.”

        <div class="activity">
            <h2>What I learnt</h2>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Initially I believed lack of platform for searching volunteering opportunities was the only problem that needed to be addressed. But throughout the design process I came across various requirements and pain points of users. The solution which I thought was pretty small turned into a complex solution with various parameters to be considered.

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">
            Although I had a limited time period to complete the assignments I did my best to focus on the Tour & Booking modules of the app. I would love to work more on this project. Some other features which can be considered for next iterations of the project are:

                <p class="/public/public/Images/text">
                    Ability to sign up for a training program if offered by the NGO before volunteering.

                    Including user’s (volunteer’s) profile which would include their resume( if volunteering for skill based projects) or past volunteer work experience. It would be easier for NGOs to recruit volunteers.

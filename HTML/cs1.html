        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="bodytext">As an artsy, I’ve always wondered what went through the artist’s brain while they created
            their
            artworks.
            What was their interpretation of it? What did they want to convey?
            These are the questions me and so many others ask when they are admiring an art piece.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p class="quotetext">“A picture is worth thousand words.”</p>
        </div>

        <p class="bodytext">But how will the people know what those words were. An audio guide would definitely be an
            answer to
            that. And thus I started my quest to create an App for Audio Tours.
            I took up this project as a part of Google’s UX Design Course. I’m more of an art enthusiast myself and
            from my first ever visit to an Art Gallery I felt like the experience could have been much more
            fulfilling. So I chose this prompt to create a compelling experience for Gallery visitors and myself.

        <p class="bodytext">I’ve presented the case study in a linear fashion but I follow a lean approach towards designing. Sometimes I brainstorm a few ideas before I’ve conducted user research. It helps me to enter the problem more naturally. Or sometimes even when I’ve completed the research and I’m still prototyping, I constantly look for any new insights from potential users. 
            I believe the process of designing is never ending because there’s no ‘Perfect’ design.

            Kruti’s journey revealed the improvement opportunities in the Gallery Visit experience. It aided to
            visualize the roadblocks in the user’s journey and ways to remove them. It helped me to move through the
            process from the user’s perspective and identify their wants and needs.

            to be included into the digital wireframes.

                experience
                how tightly knitted research and design phase is and how small iterations can have a large impact on
